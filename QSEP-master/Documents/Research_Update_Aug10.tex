\section{\scshape Overview}

\begin{frame}{Research Questions}
Original
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can we identify a dataset containing the pediatric illness populations of interest and their immediate family members? 
	\item Can we quantify the outcomes of interest and their relationship to the hypothesized mediating factors? 
	\item Do we see any significant secondary effects of pediatric illness on family members, in comparison to a sensibly-defined control group? 
\end{itemize}
Updated 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Do we see a difference in adult family member spending before and after a child is diagnosed?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{\scshape Data}

\begin{frame}
Number of children under 16 with each condition, enrolled for more than 3 months, and for whom we have at least one month of spend data before diagnosis. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Total sick children under 16: 136,791
	\item Unique Families: 122,588 
	\item Asthma:  87,872
	\item Autism (ASD): 8,732
	\item Cancer: 27,466
	\item Cerebral Palsy: 1,440
	\item Type 1 Diabetes (T1D): 1,434
	\item Traumatic Event: 22,313
	\item Multiple Conditions: 11,756
\end{itemize}	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Data Cleaning }
\begin{itemize}
	\item To identify parents/guardians in the household used the criteria:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Same household as sick child
			\item Older than 15
			\item At least 15 years older than the sick child 
			\item No more than 60 years older than the sick child
			\item Within 15 years of the age of the oldest member of the household
		\end{itemize} 
	\item Use months within 9 months of child's diagnosis. 
	\item Only include adult family members with at least 2 months of claims before diagnosis and 2 months after, including month of diagnosis. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\section{\scshape Modeling}

\begin{frame}{Models}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Goal: model monthly spend per adult family member before and after diagnosis.
	\item Approach: Use a hierarchical model
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Model the probability that monthly spend is non-zero using logistic regression on confounders and 
		indicator of after diagnosis. 
		\item Conditioned on the fact that spend is non-zero model the total spend using lognormal regression on confounders and indicator of after diagnosis. 
	\end{enumerate}	
	\item Models were fit separately by gender of adult.
	\item Predictions are calculated as the predicted probability of non-zero spend multiplied by the predicted spend given that spend is non-zero. 
	\item Determine confidence intervals for predictions by bootstrapping (re-sample members with replacement and re-calculate predictions)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Confounders}
\begin{itemize}
	\item RAF categories: 0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 200 
	\item Income categories: 0, 50, 100, 150, 260 (thousands)
	\item Plan Type: Gated HMO, Choice Plus, Select Plus, Choice, Other
	\item Indicator of only one adult on the plan that meets the above criteria 
	\item Number of children on plan: 1, 2-4, 5+
	\item Indicator of multiple sick children
	\item Age category of youngest child: Infant, Child, Teenager
	\item Months Enrolled
	\item Time (natural spline)
	\item Adult age (natural spline)
\end{itemize}  
\end{frame}
