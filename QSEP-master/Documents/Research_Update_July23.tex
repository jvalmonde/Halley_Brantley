\section{\scshape Overview}

\begin{frame}{Research Questions}
Original
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can we identify a dataset containing the pediatric illness populations of interest and their immediate family members? 
	\item Can we quantify the outcomes of interest and their relationship to the hypothesized mediating factors? 
	\item Do we see any significant secondary effects of pediatric illness on family members, in comparison to a sensibly-defined control group? 
\end{itemize}
Updated 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Do we see a difference in adult family member spending before and after a child is diagnosed?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{\scshape Data}

\begin{frame}{Dataset - from data team}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Count of sick children (under 24) in our dataset:  275,819
	\item Total member count (family members \& sick children combined): 968,471
	\item Total family count: 237,829
	\item Dataset covers year 2014-2016 and includes months since diagnosis, median household income, distance to PCP. 
	\item Between 65-70\% of members in each year were enrolled for 12 months
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Number of Children Under 16 with each condition}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Total sick children under 16: 159,792 
	\item Asthma:  99,065
	\item Autism (ASD): 10,966 
	\item Cancer: 29,572
	\item Cerebral Palsy: 1,802
	\item Type 1 Diabetes (T1D): 2,089
	\item Traumatic Event: 29,159
	\item Multiple Conditions: 12,142
\end{itemize}	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Number of children under 16 with each condition, enrolled for more than 3 months, and for whom we have at least one month of spend data before diagnosis. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Total sick children under 16: 136,791
	\item Unique Families: 122,588 
	\item Asthma:  87,872
	\item Autism (ASD): 8,732
	\item Cancer: 27,466
	\item Cerebral Palsy: 1,440
	\item Type 1 Diabetes (T1D): 1,434
	\item Traumatic Event: 22,313
	\item Multiple Conditions: 11,756
\end{itemize}	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Data Cleaning }
\begin{itemize}
	\item To identify parents/guardians in the household used the criteria:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Same household as sick child
			\item Older than 15
			\item At least 15 years older than the sick child 
			\item No more than 60 years older than the sick child
			\item Within 15 years of the age of the oldest member of the household
		\end{itemize} 
	\item Typically 1 or 2 members per household that meet these criteria, although several households have 3. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\section{\scshape Modeling}

\begin{frame}{Models}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Goal: model monthly spend per adult family member before and after diagnosis.
	\item Model 1: Treat spend as binary and model probability of non-zero spend
	\item Model 2: Look at only positive values of spend and model log total allowed amount. 
	\item Models were fit using generalized additive models to incorporate non-linear effects
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Predictors}
\begin{itemize}
\item Non-linear Predictors:  
\begin{itemize}
	\item Adult's age
	\item Sick child's age
	\item Median household income
\end{itemize}
\item Linear predictors:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Time
	\item RAF categories 
	\item Plan Type: Gated HMO, Choice Plus, Select Plus, Choice, Other
	\item Indicator of male
	\item Indicator of only one adult on the plan that meets the above criteria (no other parents on plan)
	\item Indicator of other children on the plan
	\item Interaction between single adult and other children
	\item Interaction between single adult and male
\end{itemize}  
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Predictors of interest:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Indicator of after child's diagnosis
	\item Interaction between after diagnosis and male
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
