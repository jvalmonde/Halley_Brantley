# Development of Post Acute Care Data Capabilities

Spending on PAC after hospitalization exceeds $60 billion per year in Medicare spending and Medicare payments for PAC has grown faster than most other categories of spending. In order to address the monumental cost of PAC, we must first build a database that captures PAC using claims data. This database will help us understand 1. the characteristics of PAC (e.g., utilization, cost) for our beneficiaries. 2. the differences in PAC between elective and non-elective procedures (e.g., what proportion of patients discharged for elective/non-elective procedures are discharged to home/non-home PAC settings) 3. the low-skilled care services provided within SNFs that could potentially be provided in home/ alternative PAC settings; and 4. potential markets that are most appropriate for seed businesses and pilot studies.
